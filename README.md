# ACL 3.0: Afolabi Computing Language

Developed by **WPWakanda LLC** / Aevov AI Technologies.

## Overview
ACL (Afolabi Computing Language) is a domain-specific language designed for **Hyper-Orchestration** and **NeuroSymbolic** computing. It serves as the native logical language of the **Nara Engine**, enabling real-time pattern recognition and spatial canvas orchestration.

## Features
- **Quantum superposition logic**: Native constructs for handling probabilistic states.
- **Neural Bridge Integration**: Direct hooks for Aevov neural resonances.
- **Spatial Canvas Orchestration**: Evaluate and emit draw commands for WebsiteCard environments.
- **Universal Optimization**: Integrated with the Nara Engine's UOE (Universal Optimization Engine).
