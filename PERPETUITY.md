# Aevov Sovereignty: Perpetual Glyph Library & Prior Art

## 🏛️ Lineage & Declaration
This repository serves as the definitive public record for the **Aevov Font/Formula Technology (AFT)**, a system of semantic glyphs developed and refined by **WPWakanda LLC** (officially recognized since 2019). 

The 333+ original foundational glyphs (from AFT Pro) and the expanded 1,000+ domain-specific mappings contained herein represent the intellectual bedrock of the **ACL (Atomic Control Logic)**.

## ⚖️ Perpetual Prior Art Advantage
By listing these glyphs in a public, timestamped, and version-controlled repository under the **Sovereign Commons** model, we declare them as **Prior Art**. 

1. **Sovereignty**: We perpetually reserve the right to use, expand, and distribute these glyphs in all Wakanda Technologies generations (1.0 through 5.0 and beyond).
2. **Open Accessibility**: Implementation code is perpetually accessible under **GPL v3**, while the logic and glyphs are protected under **Polyform Non-Commercial 1.0.0** to prevent corporate exploitation.
3. **Defense Against Encroachment**: Any attempt by third parties to claim ownership or restrict the use of these symbols is invalidated by the public existence of this library, which predates any future claims.

## 🧬 Anyonic Fractionalization
These glyphs are not merely icons; they are the visual representation of **Anyonic Fractionalization**—a method of lossless semantic compression where entire phrases, concepts, and logic operations are reduced to single Atomic Glyphs.

## ⚛️ The AFT Collective
AFT is not a static library. It is a living, evolving script of human-machine resonance.
- **AFT Pro**: The 333 foundational glyphs.
- **AFT Extended**: 1,000+ glyphs for Science, Law, Medicine, and Software.
- **AFT Quantum**: Fractal-composed glyphs for the Cognitive Mesh.
